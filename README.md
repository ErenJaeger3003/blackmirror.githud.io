<h3><p>1. Do we need an opinion, something to belive, or some kind of knowledge about the limits of technology? and why?</p>

<p>2. Do you think that technology improves our knowledge tools and habilities? and why?</p>  


<p> 1.	I think we do have to get a knowledge and an opinion about the limits of technology.  This way we will be able to make a difference between the pros and cons of any kind of technology. For example,   I can understand very well everything related to Instagram, but also I understand when to start and to stop using it, so I wouldn`t become dependent on this type of social networks.

<p> 2.	I think technology has many advantages and disadvantages for us. For instance, technology has been an excellent tool for medicine, transport, construction and communication among other human needs.</p>

 Through technology we can keep on constructing our own knowledge, ideas, theories, thinking, concepts, etc. So, I`m totally sure that it depends just on us the way we in which we use this technology: in order to stop thinking, or in order to keep on learning?
